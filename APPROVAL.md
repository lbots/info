# Approval
LBots won't accept all submitted bots when they don't fulfill the requirement.  
This document will list our requirements, what they mean and what you have to do in order to fulfill those requirements.

## Requirements
We will deny your bot if...
- it violates the Terms of Service from Discord.
- it is a clone of an existing bot. This also includes customized clones of RedBot. We won't accept any Red-Clone.
- you abuse it for advertisement, spam or similar (i.e. sending DMs to all members of a Discord).
- it stays offline for most of the time. Downtime for maintenance are okay but should be small.
- it has a bad, unpolished feel to it (Like being made of different code-examples or using stuff in a bad way).
- it provides NSFW content in non-NSFW channels.
- you (the owner or co-owner) aren't in the Discord. Your bot will be removed when you leave.

## FAQ

### Why do you not accept RedBot-Clones?
It is nearly impossible nowerdays to check if the provided bot has enough changes to call it a separate bot from RedBot.  
It is also difficult to check a bot and compare it to RedBot, since not all staff-members have access to the original and it would also take a lot of time to compare everything to it.

### Why do I have to be on the Discord?
Being on the Discord gives you a way to stay up to date with changes to our site and/or Discord.  
It also gives you a way to see the current approval-status of your bot and can also give you a chance to fix appearing issues that could cause a denial of your bot.

### What do you define as spam and advertisement?
**Spam**: Fast, continuos sending of multiple messages that may or may not be the exact same.  
**Adverising**: The unallowed sending of Links (Discord invites, bot-list links, etc) for events, your bot, etc.

Feel free to ask a staff if you can send a certain link in the Discord, if you're unclear if it would be adverising.
