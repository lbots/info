## Common issues of Discords
Discord allows everyone to create a own Server for free without any ads or restrictions.  
The issue there is, that many users make the same mistakes over and over again without realising it.  
This document lists some, if not all issues and gives ideas on how to prevent and fix them.

## Terms
This file contains certain terms that are used and may be unknown for you or others.  
Here is a small explanation of those terms.

| Term: | Meaning:                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------- |
| Guild | The Discord Server a bot/member is on |

### Bot Guilds
This is something most Bot-developers know all to well: Guilds that have more bots than users.  
There are so many Guilds that have 1 user and well over 50 bots on it. Even Guilds with way over 1,000 Bots and less than 10 users isn't that uncommon.  
The solution to this is really simple: Don't constantly invite bots. Get friends and like-minded people instead of bots.

### "n invites = 1 nitro" and other Reward Guilds
A other common issue existing are Guilds where the owner rewards people for inviting n people to their Guild.  
This is annoying and can even be seen against Discord's ToS and Guidelines, since it animates people to DM-Advertise or advertise in general which is just wrong.
